Testing Arduino with python

Idea:
-----

Make a web app that sends a post message to the serial port where the arduino is connected and
the arduino shows this message in a Small Display(don't know what's the component name...)


Done So far:
------------

* Web App
* Post Method
* Arduino Connection
* Sending Msg to Serial Port
* Arduino Turns a LED On or Off if the message says so... just to test
